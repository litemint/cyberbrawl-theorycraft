Game Design: [blockchain-game-design-cyberbrawl-stellar](/posts/blockchain-game-design-cyberbrawl-stellar/)  

## Rationale

**Game Balance:** Prevent deck configurations that could lead to infinite loops or game deadlocks, regardless of special card combinations.

**Strategic Depth:** Enable diverse playstyles (Aggro, Control, etc.) through flexible deck composition while maintaining competitive balance.

**Streamlined Gameplay:** Eliminate deck depletion concerns, allowing players to focus on strategy rather than card counting.

## Rotation

**Core Mechanic**: Cards cycle to the bottom of your deck after being played, creating a predictable rotation pattern.

**Forced Draw** (Victory Rush, Trojan): Inserts cards at the top of your deck without disrupting the existing order. These cards enter the normal rotation cycle after being drawn.

**Overclocking:** Permanently increases your hand size to 4 cards for the remainder of the game.

**Multi-Draw** (Fast Hands): Adds extra cards beyond your current hand limit (3 cards normally, 4 with Overclocking). Normal drawing resumes only when your hand drops to your hand limit or below.

**Special Case**: Boomerang re-enters rotation after a full cycle but doesn't retrigger its forced draw effect—it only activates once per play.

## Favorite Cards Probabilities Sheet

This spreadsheet calculates your odds of drawing specific cards based on your deck composition and favorite card selections. Understanding these probabilities helps you balance reliability on specific draws.

## Shuffle Pseudo code

```
// Initialize base card sets
Initialize BaseDamageSet  = [card_01_00005, card_01_00008, card_01_00010, card_01_00011]
Initialize BaseHealSet    = [card_01_00003, card_01_00006, card_01_00009]
Initialize BaseEnergySet  = [card_01_00001, card_01_00004, card_01_00007]

// Prepare player deck
Remove all passive cards from PlayerDeck
While PlayerDeck has less than 4 cards
    Add one card_01_00002 (Hellfire I) to PlayerDeck

// Shuffle all sets
Randomly shuffle BaseDamageSet
Randomly shuffle BaseHealSet
Randomly shuffle BaseEnergySet
Randomly shuffle PlayerDeck

// Trim to rotation limit
Trim PlayerDeck to 10 cards (max rotation)

// Apply special card replacements
If player has card_02_00060 (Brawler)
    Replace the first BaseHealSet card with card_02_00061 (Brawl)

If player has card_02_00031 (Primal Overload)
    Replace card_01_00001 (Overload I) with card_02_00031 (Primal Overload) in BaseEnergySet

If player has card_02_00050 (Hellfire spec)
    Replace BaseDamageSet with [card_02_00054, card_02_00054, card_02_00054, card_02_00054] (Primal Hellfire)

// Build final deck in rotation groups
Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[0], BaseHealSet[0], BaseEnergySet[0], PlayerDeck[0], PlayerDeck[1])
Add the result to FinalDeck

Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[1], BaseDamageSet[3], BaseEnergySet[1], PlayerDeck[2])
Add the result to FinalDeck

Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[2], BaseHealSet[2], BaseEnergySet[2], PlayerDeck[3])
Add the result to FinalDeck

If PlayerDeck length > 4
    Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[0], BaseHealSet[1], BaseEnergySet[0], PlayerDeck[4])
    Add the result to FinalDeck

If PlayerDeck length > 5
    Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[1], BaseDamageSet[3], BaseEnergySet[1], PlayerDeck[5])
    Add the result to FinalDeck

If PlayerDeck length > 6
    Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[2], BaseHealSet[2], BaseEnergySet[2], PlayerDeck[6])
    Add the result to FinalDeck

If PlayerDeck length > 7
    Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[0], BaseHealSet[1], BaseEnergySet[0], PlayerDeck[7])
    Add the result to FinalDeck

If PlayerDeck length > 8
    Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[1], BaseDamageSet[3], BaseEnergySet[1], PlayerDeck[8])
    Add the result to FinalDeck

If PlayerDeck length > 9
    Randomly shuffle (BaseDamageSet[2], BaseHealSet[2], BaseEnergySet[2], PlayerDeck[9])
    Add the result to FinalDeck  
    
// Apply favorite card mechanic
Initialize FavoriteCardSet with all player favorited cards (starred), excluding passive cards
Randomly shuffle FavoriteCardSet

For each FavoriteCard in FavoriteCardSet
    If PlayerDeck has card_02_00056 (Chosen One) or getRandom(0,1) <= 0.75
       Move FavoriteCard to a random position within the first 3 cards in FinalDeck
       break

Filter FinalDeck to remove duplicates, allowing only card_02_00054 and all _01_ cards to remain
return FinalDeck
```
